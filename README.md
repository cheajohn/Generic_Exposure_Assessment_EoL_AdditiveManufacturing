# Generic_Exposure_Assessment_EoL_AdditiveManufacturing
This repository contains the data supporting the generic exposure assessment associated with the management of end-of-life (EoL) materials following additive manufacturing.

Associated Manuscript Title: Generic Exposure Assessment of End-of-Life Material Management in Additive Manufacturing pending submission to the Environmental Science and Technology Journal. 

Summary of the Project: Additive manufacturing (AM) offers many material manufacturing techniques for a wide range of applications across many industries. Most efforts at process optimization and exposure assessment for AM are centered around the manufacturing process. However, addressing chemical safety and releases in end-of-life (EoL) management is crucial to mitigating potential environmental and occupational health impacts.  This work examines the theoretical occupational hazards during AM EoL material management practices by tracking discarded materials and releases through a material flow analysis, which revealed that over 63% of the generated AM EoL materials are incinerated with minimal (8%) material recovery. The generated dataset was subsequently used to estimate occupational impacts through generic exposure scenario assessment, highlighting the importance of ventilation and personal protective equipment at all stages of AM material management. The AM EoL management-specific analysis presented in this work identifies sources of pollution and offers insights for policymakers and stakeholders to inform pollution prevention and exposure minimization strategies.

This repository contains an Excel spreadsheet used to calculate material flow of materials exiting additive manufacturing. Parameters and assumptions are listed in the “EoL Material Flow Analysis” Tab. All references leading to the necessary parameters and assumptions are listed in the “Reference ID” tab. The identity of EoL materials is available as Table S1 in the word information document titled “Chea et al - GS AM EoL Analysis_SupportingInfo”.
